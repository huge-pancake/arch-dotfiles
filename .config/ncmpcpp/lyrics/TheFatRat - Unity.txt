Stand together like we're rocks in a wall
Growing stronger everyday, even more
Stand together in the eye of the storm
And show the whole world who we are, oh

Keep on walking to the sound of the drums
Feel the fire run through our lungs
Find our treasure in the light of the sun
And show the whole world who we are, oh
